 little doc

things i need to research:
instantiation of objects (maybe its just scene.add), hit detection(trancing, bulletspawn),
events and or colision, possibly text actually

juice ideas:
impulse reaction of a duck getting hit, the other ducks get tiltet away from the impact point, curtains move
particles, ofc. satisfying hit sounds, woow and ooh sounds(could be annoying).
quack sounds, water splashes

tinted Ducks that give special effects when hit. could be highlighted with a gasp sound on spawn
and point lights highlighting it. confetti when hit, like a proper circus
Homing bullets, bullet refill, inifite bullets

BIG Bullets (would require slower ducks that have multiple targets(and more HP) where all targets need to be hit)
environment interaction. Everytime player shoots tent in the back it moves(along with curtains).
Player shoots curtain 5 times, it falls down. Another color appears.
can repeat 3 times, after blue comes red then green after that the wood wall.
That one will move lightly whenever it is hit


 standard crosshair that is moved with the mouse and the camera (or the objects)
are slightly moving depending on the position of the cursor


stage 1 tutorial
    dimmed background highlighting a single duck. With a message "click to shoot"/"can you hit the duck?"
    *player shoots*
    -> hits duck: confetti, lights turn on, normal game starts
    -> doesnt hit duck: ???
stage 2 game loop
